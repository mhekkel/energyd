Version 2.5.0
  
- added webapp, a base class used to create web applications,
  it uses XHTML templates to fill in. It uses a script language
  to enable interaction with the C++ code.

Version 2.1.0

- support for HTTP/1.1
- added multiplication in xpath expression language... oops
- revised interface for container::iterator, now it is possible
  to use more STL and boost functions on a container directly, like:
  
  xml::container cnt = ...;
  foreach (node* n, cnt) { cout << n->name() << endl; }
